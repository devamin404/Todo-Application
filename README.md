This project is made with React js
In this the flow is in my App.js you will watch all the components that are defined there like Todoform etc
So you have to read App.js then you have to go to components in which the flow is as follows:
Todoform.js is the first component and then comes Todos.js and then Todo.js
In this way you will understand the flow of my code
This application is very basic you can add more features to it like saving all the todos in browser windos by use of localStorage etc
