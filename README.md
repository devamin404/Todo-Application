This project is made with HTML, CSS and React js
The working flow is in my App.js you will watch all the components that are defined there like Todoform etc
So you have to read App.js then you have to go to components in which the flow is as follows:
Todoform.js is the first component and then comes Todos.js and then Todo.js(indivdual todo)
In this way you will understand the flow of my code
One important thing for running of this project you have to install node modules folder
Just clone my project in Vs code studio and then in terminal run the command "npm i"
It will install node modules folder which contain all dependencies of your folder then in terminal type "npm run dev"
Your project is live on local host now
This application is very basic you can add more features to it like saving all the todos in browser windows by use of localStorage etc
